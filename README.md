## More About Windows Sandbox

### What Is Windows Sandbox
Technically Windows Sandbox is a lightweight virtual machine created on demand which a user can safely run applications in isolation. This virtual machine is using the same OS image as in the host machine. Software installed inside the Windows Sandbox environment remains "sandboxed" and runs separately from the base machine.

### What are the drawbacks
A sandbox is temporary. When it's closed, all the software and files and the state are deleted. You get a brand-new instance of the sandbox every time you open the application.

Software and applications installed on the host aren't directly available in the sandbox. If you need specific applications available inside the Windows Sandbox environment, they must be explicitly installed within the environment every time.

### What is ScoopBox
Since the state clears every time ScoopBox helps you launch the Windows Sandbox with preinstalled applications using a package managers like Scoop, Chocolate, Winget etc..
